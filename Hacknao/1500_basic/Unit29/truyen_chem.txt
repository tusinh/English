1. Ho Chi Minh

Ho Chi Minh, the man, had many names. He was born Nguyen Sinh Cung, but also known as Nguyen Tat Thanh,
Nguyen Ai Quoc and his nickname uncle Ho. He was a Communist revolutionary leader who was also the former
Prime Minister and President of the Democratic republic of VietNam. He spent much time of his life fighting
for liberty of VietNam that had been a French colony for more than six decades.
Uncle Ho was a man of supernative potiential. He was not only a politician but also a writer, poet and even a
philosopher. There are many stories about the travels and different countries that Uncle Ho lived in. He was 
said to have visited for lived in France, the United States, the United Kingdom, the USSR, China and even ThaiLan.
During his time in France is when he became interested in politics and received sufficient education and 
experience. He started writting articles and constructing petitions with VietNamese nationallists living in Paris,
France, advocating the independence of VietNam. After years of traveling around the world he eventually returned
to VietNam in the 1940's to be involved in the August Revolution, against French colonial rule. The result of the
revolution was the Viet Minh (Leage for independence of VietNam) seizing power of majority of rural villages and 
cities throughout the North, Center and South VietName, including Ha Noi. Uncle Ho then became Chairman of
Provisonal Goverment and issued a Proclamation of independence of the Democratic republic of VietNam.
The evolution of Uncle Ho was complete when on 2 Septemper 1945, following Vietname's Emperor Dai Bao'abdication,
he read the Declaration of independence of VietNam in Ba Dinh square, looking to reform VietName's political
situation.
Uncle Ho went on fighting of VietNam until the end of his life. To get Vietname true independence was a much
longer procedure and didn't happen until April 30, 1975 with North Vietnam regaining control of South VietNam
after victories against American and French forces.This finally constitued Vietnam as united and free.
Uncle Ho is now considered a legend without weakness in Vietnam, and SaiGon was renamed Ho Chi Minh, after the
American War, to commemorate the hero.
