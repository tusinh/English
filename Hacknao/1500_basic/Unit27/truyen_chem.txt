1. Topic: Poor man's financial crisis

A rich Vietnamese couple just found out that they lost all their money in a bad investment.
-Viet: Babe, we have a crisis goign on here, we need to call our accountant right now!
-Quyen: What is it now?
-Viet: We're poor! That lying finacial advisor tricked us and got us invest in penny-stocks.
-Quyen: Well why would you invest in penny-stocks   you idiot, you have a better chance of winninng
the lottery than making money from those.
-Viet: The costs of the stocks fluctuates so quickly there is a chance to earn a big dividend. But
the advisor lied to me, I was scammed.
-Quyen: Well it's not very wise to invest your money when you know nothing about finance.
-Viet: Can you just helpp me, please? What is our accountant's phone number?
-Quyen: Why are you paniking? You still have plenty of money in your savings account, you told me you
were going to deposit money in there yesterday. Relax, it's not like we're in debt.
-Viet: Oh...Well that wasn't exactly accurate information....
-Quyen: Wait, is there something you're not telling to me?
-Viet: Well, actually yesterday I sort of went to the casino.
-Quyen: You lost all your money at the casino? I knew it! You're lucky we still have my savings account
that my father set up for me/
-Viet: Um, actually I used the money in your account for a down-payment on a new Mercedes Benz.
-Quyen: What? You took my debit card from my wallet without my permission to buy another car?
-Viet: Hey, we find room in our budget to buy all your shoes, dresses and cosmetics. All those expenses
start to accumulate you know. I don't see why I can't treat myself to something too!
-Quyen: Well, you already own a lot of money to my father, he's not going to help you this time.
-Viet: Oh please, you have to talk to him! Tell him I will promise to refund him all money this time.
-Quyen: No...
-Viet: Well maybe I could exchange with him the new car for some cash.
-Quyen: I think I will just exchange you instead. I want to divorce you.
-Viet: What? But don't you still love me?
-Quyen: Not if you're poor honey, sorry.
