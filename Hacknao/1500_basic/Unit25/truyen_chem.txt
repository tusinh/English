Hey man!
Got a randome favor to ask, but I ordered a bunch of dog whistles for my dog-sitting business(Woofy walks Enterprises)
that operate on the weekends.We're looking to build up our inventory with some really nice equipment. The problem is,
all the dog whistles are being to delivered to the office today at 3:00 pm and I won't be there to receive them.
I'll be out at a conference with the boss today.
So, can you meet the DHL guy in the lobby when he makes the delivery and sign for me ?
I'm aware I shouldn't be having personal things shipped too our office, but the delivery was actually more affordable if
I had it shipped to the office. Just keepp this between us, OK ?
The label on the box should read "Pawcasso Exports: Established in 2008". It's a huge pet supply business in Sweden that you might
have heard of.
Since the whitles are imports, I'v obviously invested a small fortune on them! So if you have a second, please open the package and
check the receipt with the invoice and make sure everything is all set. There should be 200 dog whistles in there. You dont have to actually
count them to see if there are 200... but if you have the spare time to do so, please be my guest. There should also be on free item,
a luxury leash made of leather, that they added to the order because it was so big. Nice of them!
So open the box and if you dont see the leash just text me so that I can duck out of the meeting and call them to make a complaint.
Thanks man, I owe you a beer. And remember, if you want to join us at Woofy Walks and make some extra money on weekends, I guarantee
I can convince my partners to bring you on board! Since I have a passion to working with pets, my strategy is to build up this side 
business so I can quit real estaste and hopefully transition over to woofy walks full time by the middle of next year.
