1. Topic : Watch the Throne

When playing the Game of Thrones you have to decide what your values are going to be. Will you be someone who
does what's right for mankind? Or will you be someone who will do whatever it takes to enhance your chances
of wearing the ever desirable Crown. Some citizens abide by the laws, and some people make their own. Morality
is the most complicated circumstance of the Game. And there are many different ways to look at each moral dilemma.
You can follow a religion or deity, like the Lord of Light, or you can do what is right based on your family, like
 the Lannisters, or by your tribe like the Dothraki. Or you can try and do what's right for all the inhabitants of
 the known world. You are free to choose any belief and any decision you desire. But every decision will have a 
 consequence, and most often it is life and death. People like Ned Stark and Stannis Baratheon chose their fate and
 look where fate brought them.

 If you choose to live a life of honor and justice, pershaps the people who choose to act selfishly will have
the edge over you, and can put the edge of their sword inside of you as well. They can do as they please without
 an honor code of what's right and wrong.

 The wealthy control the armies and therefore they vested with the power to rule. And they rule with fear, so they
must assert their power. But a girl named Deanerys and her dragons are trying to change that . She will try to seize
power with justice, not with wealth.

Will society be happy with someone more noble as their ruler? Or will they always feel oppressed and deprived
 by those in power? Wil the White Walkers come and destroy everything so that nothing even matters? The answers to
 these questions are still unknown. But the show has made somthing very clear, and that's that your only assurance
 in life is your death... Unless you are Jon Snow, then death can't even stop you enjoy your Game of Thrones!
